## Project Overview

This repository contains our submission for Stage 2 MVP of PRoDIGI 2022, organized by Cognizant Technological Solution Corporation. The objective of our project was to develop an e-commerce platform that provides recommended shades of colors for makeup, clothes, etc., based on user preferences and skin type.

## Technologies Used

The technologies and tools used in this project include:

- Python (Django): Python-based web framework for developing the backend of the e-commerce platform.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the content of web pages.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the visual elements of web pages.
- Bootstrap: Front-end framework for building responsive and visually appealing web pages.
- JavaScript: Programming language for implementing interactive features and logic in the web pages.

These technologies formed the foundation for developing our e-commerce platform and enabling the recommendation system for shades of colors.

## Features

Our e-commerce platform includes the following key features:

1. Shade Recommendation: Users can input their preferences and skin type, and the platform will provide recommended shades of colors for makeup, clothes, etc.
2. User Preferences: Users can set their preferences for specific products or categories to receive personalized recommendations.
3. Skin Type Analysis: The platform incorporates an analysis of the user's skin type to suggest shades that best complement their complexion.
4. Product Catalog: A comprehensive catalog of makeup, clothes, and related products is available for users to explore and make purchases.

These features are designed to provide a personalized shopping experience and assist users in finding shades of colors that suit their preferences and skin type.
